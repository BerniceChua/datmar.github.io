      I should start by saying hello. My name is Darius, and I recently joined DevBootcamp to become a web developer. I am one week into my learning, and will presently be making the world's quickest turnaround from student to teacher. First up: the benefits of version control. Version control as it relates to code is the process of tracking the evolution of a code over time as a series of snapshots in time. Think of a basic program: making a hash of names and corresponding heights, and then converting the heights from feet and inches to centimeters. Version control allows you to save a 'version' of your code after you have made the tediously large hash. Now, if you completely mess up the implementation of converting all of those heights from feet/inches to centimeters you don't have to worry because you have a version of your code just before you botched it! Furthermore, if you have a more complex problem, version control allows you to work on separate parts of your code in different versions, called branches, at the same time, without affecting each other. They can then be merged together to make one beautiful program.
    </p>

      Git is the version control system that I am currently working with. It is a local system, meaning it saves versions solely within my hard drive. Git helps me keep track of changes with 'commits,' which are akin to save checkpoints in a video game. Every time you have made a change to your code, or added a file that you think is significant, you can add these changes to your branch and then commit it, which includes a description of your changes since the previous commit. This allows you to view all of your changes over time by viewing your commit log.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what happens if you want to work on a coding project with someone else? This is where GitHub comes into the picture. GitHub is a remote version control system that can sync with, and can sync to your local git repositories. You can, for example, go to a colleague's repository on GitHub, 'pull' that code onto your local git system, make meaningful contributions, and then 'push' that code back onto GitHub. Now, if you did this responsibly, your colleague will be able to see a separate branch (or version) of the code on GitHub, and decide whether or not he wants to merge your contributions with his code. This functionality extends to extremely complex projects with potentially hundreds of developers contributing over its lifespan. In addition, there is also the added benefit of being able to access your code remotely from different computers.

      I am excited to take the leap into the world of development, and I'm pretty sure I will be coding less anxiously knowing I have version control as a safety net every step of the way.

      Thanks for tuning in,
